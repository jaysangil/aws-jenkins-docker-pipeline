---

## **Project Summary**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline using **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **Maven** to build, test, and deploy a Java-based web application in a containerized environment hosted on **AWS EC2** instances.

### **Purpose**

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Automate the build, test, and deployment processes for Java web applications.
- Leverage containerization with Docker to ensure portability and consistency across environments.
- Use Jenkins as the CI/CD tool to streamline and manage the entire pipeline.
- Host the deployment on AWS EC2 instances for scalability and flexibility.

### **What It Does**

- **Source Code Integration:**
  - Pulls the Java web application source code from a GitHub repository.

- **Automated Build:**
  - Uses Maven to compile and package the application.

- **Artifact Deployment:**
  - Transfers the `.war` file to a Docker host on AWS.

- **Containerized Deployment:**
  - Builds a Docker image and runs the application inside a container.

- **Continuous Monitoring:**
  - Jenkins triggers automatic builds and deployments based on Git changes or scheduled intervals.

### **Key Technologies**

| **Technology** | **Purpose**                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Jenkins**    | Automate CI/CD processes                   |
| **Docker**     | Containerize and deploy the web application|
| **Maven**      | Build and manage Java project dependencies |
| **AWS EC2**    | Host the Jenkins server and Docker host    |
| **GitHub**     | Store and manage source code               |

### **Design Features**

1. **Automated Pipeline:**
   - Fully automated CI/CD process reduces manual intervention.
2. **Scalability:**
   - Deployable in cloud environments, with seamless scaling using AWS EC2.
3. **Portability:**
   - Containerized deployment ensures consistency across different environments.

```

### **Usage**

This pipeline can be used for:
- **Web Application Development:** Automating the deployment of web apps in development and production environments.
- **DevOps Practices:** Demonstrating best practices for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Cloud Deployments:** Showcasing containerized deployments in AWS.
